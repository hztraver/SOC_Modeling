# R code and datasets supporting the publication "Travers-Smith et al., (2024). Response of soil organic pools to treeline advance in the continuous permafrost zone, western Canadian Arctic"

The four datasets include:
- **01_transect_clusters**: Landsat and topographic variables aggregated for each transect used to classify the three ecological treeline types. 
  - **01b_transect_boxplots**: Clustering variables within 30m sample plots used to generate Figure 3
- **02_veg_fg**: Percent cover of species within each vegetation plot (n=55)
- **03_SOC**: All soil sample data joined to vegetation structure (3m plots) and microtopography (pixel value at sample location) from the drone CHM and DTM. Tree stem density is calculated from number of stems > 2.5m within 30m plot of each sample location
- **04_landsat_predictors**: Landsat spectral indices joined to drone metrics aggregated to 30m resolution (mean ExG per pixel, maximum canopy height, tree stem count)
